1. Spectral Position Equation

We define the spectral coordinate of each logic variable  as a spiral point in the complex plane:

s_i = s_0 + r_i \cdot e^{i \theta_i}

Where:

: Complex spectral coordinate of variable 

: Central origin from Alaa’s critical phase equation (e.g., )

: Radius based on Collatz logic depth:


: Logical phase angle:

 if  (⏫ upward)

 if  (⏬ downward)

2. Clause Activation Rule

Each clause  is considered satisfied if at least one of its spectral coordinates  lies within the activation region defined by the clause.

The logic proceeds as:

Evaluate  for each variable in the clause

Check angular coherence between them

Detect interference or contradiction zones visually or via angle modulation

3. Global Collapse Test

If all clauses are satisfied, the SAT instance is considered spectrally resolved. Otherwise, contradictions appear as angular divergences or distortions in the spectral structure.

We use angle interference and collapse length to reduce unsatisfiable configurations.

Note: This method does not brute-force all combinations but uses spiral logic wave interference to naturally collapse invalid branches.
