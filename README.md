1. Spectral Position Equation

s_i = s_0 + r_i \cdot e^{i\theta_i}

Where:

: Spiral spectral position of logic variable  in the complex plane.

: Central complex origin from Alaa’s critical phase equation. Example:


s_0 = \frac{1}{2} + i \cdot t_k \quad (\text{with } t_k \text{ from Alaa’s Riemann zero engine})

r_i = \frac{1}{\text{length of Collatz sequence}(x_i)}

: if  (↑ upward)

: if  (↓ downward)

2. Clause Activation Rule

Each clause of the form:

(x_a \lor \neg x_b \lor x_c)

The logic flow is:

1. Map each  to its spiral spectral position .


2. Measure interference or angular distortion in the clause.


3. If all variables in the clause point downward (θ = 3π/2), contradiction is detected.

3. Global Collapse Principle

If all clauses in the formula are satisfied under the spectral configuration, the SAT instance is resolved. Otherwise, contradiction zones emerge as angular misalignments or destructive interference in the spiral.

This system mimics logic resonance, not brute-force. It resolves constraints through natural collapse of invalid branches based on logic wave symmetry and spiral depth.

Note: This equation is part of the spectral logic framework integrating Riemann-based phase modeling with logical evaluation.
